## About this repository

This repository contains the code and dataset of our paper with working title "The effect of regional institutional quality on entrepreneurial flourishing in decentralized Indonesia" with Andree Surianta. Results are in reg4, fig and tab. We generate these results with R and RStudio. The main R file is the ufm.R which contains everything.

Mind you this is a working paper and the code is not yet clean.

## About the dataset

The data in this paper are mainly drawn from two sources: the Regional Competitiveness Index (Indeks Daya Saing Daerah/IDSD). The IDSD is an annual index published by Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency (Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional/BRIN) from 2022. It is inspired by the World Economic Forum’s GCI which measures countries’ competitiveness as the sum of its institutions, policies, and factors that drive productivity. Readers interested in learning more about how this index is calculated can refer to the IDSD 2023 report listed in the bibliography (Ontowirjo et al., 2024)

We combine this IDSD with the Micro and Small Industries Profiles from each district.

Data spans only 2 years, 2022 and 2023, as for the time of writing. Feel free to use, but be very cautious because data is a bit funny especially the 2022 (see our paper for more discussion on this issue)
